# Plan for presentation on statistics and bioinformatics

----

How to structure the presentation?

- Talk or guided conversation

- Focus on:

    - models we use everyday (and might misunderstand)
    
        - can we reimplement limma / edgeR from first principles
        
        - can we extend limma / edgeR using stan|jags / lme4 / Manova

    - novel / nonstandard techniques that lie under the hood of tools we use
    everyday

    - should it be "interesting new stuff" or "understanding the basics"?

----

What topics to include?

- What training is provided for UoG staff / researchers

- What is / is not covered in the MSc

- Tools / resources to improve statistical understanding of collaborators /
  bioinformaticians

- Interesting uses of stats in recent papers / projects

- Compare some basic statistical models / methods using different tools

- Comparative analysis of a dataset using different models

- Local statistical reseearchers / meetups etc
