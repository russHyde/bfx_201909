# Git repositories that are to be cloned into the current project
# - `url` can either be a github/bitbucket or other external repo or a
# directory on the user's computer (though I'd urge against the latter)
# - `commit` should be (at least) the 7-mer prefix for the specific commit that
# is to be checked out (use the SHA1 code, not HEAD/MASTER or similar since
# only the former is future proof)
# - `output` should be defined relative to the current project's working
# directory (don't use full filepaths)

# repo_identifier:
#     url: git@github.com:user/my_package.git
#     commit: zyx9876
#     output: ./lib/cloned_packages/my_package
