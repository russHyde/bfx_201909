# Job-specific files that must exist prior to running the workflow
# The files are 'touch'ed if they do not exist at the point where the current
#   job is setup (by calling ./scripts/setup.sh)

# File format:
# - ^relative/path/to/filename$
# - One line per directory
# - Paths relative to working directory (ie, the dir containing conf/ doc/
# scripts/ etc)

# Examples:
# ./lib/conf/include_into_rpackage.txt
# TODO.txt
